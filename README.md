# NeoFinRL
A collection of universal environments for DRL in quant finance.


# Why NeoFinRL (FinRL-Gym): Motivation

● To close the sim-reality gap: existing academic AI+Finance papers use backtesting on historical data, the reported performance (annualized return, shape ratio, max dropdown, etc.) may be quite different when we apply the algorithms to a paper/live trading, or real markets.

● To reduce the data pre-processing burden, so that quants can focus on developing their strategies.

● To facilitate fair comparisons or benchmark performances, providing standardized envs will allow researchers to evaluate different strategies in some way. Also, it would help researchers to better understand the “black-box” algorithm.

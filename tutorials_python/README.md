**Mission**: to provide user-friendly demos using python. Users can run them locally. Moreover, developers can dubug them locally to identify bugs; however, using notebooks is impossible.


**Principles**: 

1) Do not define any function, and put the functins to python files out of tutorials_notebook and tutorials_python.
2) The codes will be copied to the corresponding notebook in tutorials_notebook.

1-Introduction: basic demos for beginners.

2-Advance: advanced demos, e.g., ensemble stock trading.

3-Practical: paper trading and live trading (To Do).

4-Optimization: hyperparameter tuning.

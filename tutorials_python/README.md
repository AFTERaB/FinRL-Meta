**OurMission**: to provide user-friendly demos using python. Users can run them locally. Moreover, developers can dubug them locally to identify bugs; however, using notebooks is impossible.


**Principles**: 

1) Do not define any function in notebooks, and put the functins to .py out of tutorials_notebook and tutorials_python.
2) The first part is installing commands. Then the second part is copied from the corresponding .py from tutorials_python.


## File Structure
There are five parts: Introduction, Advance, Practical, Optimization, and Others.

Part Introduction involves seveval basic demos, which are prepared for beginners.

Part Advance involves some advanced demos, e.g., ensemble stock trading.

Part Practical involves paper trading and live trading (in the future).

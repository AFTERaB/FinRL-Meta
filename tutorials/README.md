**Mission**: provide more than 100 user-friendly demos in notebooks and python. 


Users can run them locally. Moreover, developers can dubug them locally; however, using notebooks is impossible.


**Principles**: 

1) Do not put definitions of functions here, which should be put in .py of the folders except tutorials_notebook and tutorials_python.
2) The codes will be copied to the corresponding notebook in tutorials_notebook.


**Principles**: 

1) Do not put definitions of functions in notebooks, which should be put in .py of the folders except tutorials_notebook and tutorials_python.

**Mission**: to provide user-friendly demos using notebooks. 

**Principles**: 

1) Do not define any function, and put these functins to .py out of tutorials_notebook and tutorials_python.
2) The first part is installing commands. Then the second part is copied from the corresponding .py from tutorials_python.

1-Introduction: basic demos, which are prepared for beginners.

2-Advance: advanced demos, e.g., ensemble stock trading.

3-Practical: paper trading and live trading (in the future).

4-Optimization: hyperparameter tuning.
